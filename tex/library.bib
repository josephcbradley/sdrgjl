  abstract = {The recent interest in aspects common to quantum information and condensed matter has prompted a flory of activity at the border of these disciplines that were far distant untill few years ago. Numerous interesting questions have been addressed so far. Here we review an important part of this field, the properties of the entanglement in many-body systems. We discuss the zero and finite temperature properties of entanglement in interacting spin, fermion and boson model systems. Both bipartite and multipartite entanglement will be considered. In equilibrium we show how entanglement is tightly connected to the characteristics of the phase diagram. The behavior of entanglement can be related, via certain witnesses, to thermodynamic quantities thus offering interesting possibilities for an experimental test. Out of equilibrium we discuss how to generate and manipulate entangled states by means of many-body Hamiltonians.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical strategy to efficiently estimate bipartite entanglement measures, and in particular the Entanglement of Formation, for many-body quantum systems on a lattice. Our approach exploits the Tree Tensor Operator tensor network ansatz, a positive loopless representation for density matrices which, as we demonstrate, efficiently encodes information on bipartite entanglement, enabling the up-scaling of entanglement estimation. Employing this technique, we observe a finite-size scaling law for the entanglement of formation in 1D critical lattice models at finite temperature for up to 128 spins, extending to mixed states the scaling law for the entanglement entropy.},

  abstract = {In most introductory courses on quantum mechanics one is taught that the Hamiltonian operator must be Hermitian in order that the energy levels be real and that the theory be unitary (probability conserving). To express the Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes \$H=H\^\textbackslash dagger\$, where the symbol \$\textbackslash dagger\$ denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is, transpose and complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical requirement of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry) without losing any of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the properties of some non-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum theories.},

  abstract = {Long-distance quantum state transfer (QST), which can be achieved with the help of quantum teleportation, is a core element of important quantum protocols. A typical situation for QST based on teleportation is one in which two remote communication partners (Alice and Bob) are far from the entanglement source (Charlie). Because of the atmospheric turbulence, it is challenging to implement the Bell-state measurement after photons propagate in atmospheric channels. In previous long-distance free-space experiments, Alice and Charlie always perform local Bell-state measurement before the entanglement distribution process is completed. Here, by developing a highly stable interferometer to project the photon into a hybrid path-polarization dimension and utilizing the satellite-borne entangled photon source, we demonstrate proof-of-principle QST at the distance of over 1200~km assisted by prior quantum entanglement shared between two distant ground stations with the satellite Micius. The average fidelity of transferred six distinct quantum states is 0.82±0.01, exceeding the classical limit of 2/3 on a single copy of a qubit.}

This is defined as the von Neumann entropy SA = -Tr ρAlogρA corresponding to the reduced density matrix ρA of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length χ is large but finite, we show that SA(c/6)log χ, where is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition. ©2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

  abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: The entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such "area laws" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium we review the current status of area laws in these fields. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation, and disordered systems, non-equilibrium situations, classical correlation concepts, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. A significant proportion of the article is devoted to the quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. We discuss matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogues, and states from entanglement renormalization and conclude by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations.},

  abstract = {The properties of spin-2 antiferromagnetic chains with various types of random exchange coupling are studied via an asymptotically exact decimation renormalization-group transformation, which is a generalization of that introduced by Dasgupta and Ma. Random-singlet phases occur in which each spin is paired with one other spin that may be very far away; more exotic phases also occur. The behavior of typical and mean correlation functions is analyzed and found to be very different, with very small sets of spins dominating the latter at long distances as well as the low-temperature thermodynamics. Some of the phase transitions that occur between antiferromagnetically ordered phases and random singlet or other antiferromagnetic phases are also analyzed. For example, if a small uniaxial anisotropy perturbation is added to a random Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain, a transition occurs from a random-singlet phase to an Ising antiferromagnetic phase, as the anisotropy changes sign from easy plane to easy axis. The staggered magnetization vanishes at the transition with critical exponent /=8/(1+\&7). Possible implications for the properties of random quantum magnetic systems in higher dimensions are briefly discussed. I. I¹RODUCTION Quantum spin chains exhibit a wide variety of interesting phenomena at low temperatures that are controlled by the behavior of their ground states and low-lying exci-tations. Broken symmetry, quasi-long-range order, effects of topology of the rotation group and assorted types of phase transitions are all found at zero temperature and have been analyzed via exact solutions, particularly Bethe's ansatz, mapping onto other solvable problems , renormalization-group treatments of effective long-wavelength actions, conformal covariance, exact numerical diagonalizations, quantum Monte Carlo simulations, series expansions, and by numerical renormalization-group computations. In the presence of quenched randomness, far less is known. In some regimes, the randomness is irrelevant at low energies and can be treated perturbatively. However , for quantum spin chains that can be mapped to free fermion systems (i.e. , XY spin chains and transverse field Ising chains), localization of the wave functions of the fermions suggests some kind of localization of spin exci-tations, although even in these cases the understanding of the low-energy behavior is far from complete. For more complicated situations such as random Heisenberg chains and systems with phase transitions as functions of anisotropy, even less is known. The competition between localization effects and order can certainly play a role, and because of the time independence of the randomness, the effects of rare regions on macroscopic properties will be far more important than for classical systems with quenched disorder. Fortunately, the one-dimensional nature of quantum spin chains enables, even in the presence of quenched randomness, progress to be made by real-space renormalization-group methods. As we shall see, these can be used, somewhat surprisingly, to obtain new exact results for the long-length scale, low-frequency behavior of randomness-dominated phases as well as the critical behavior near to various zero-temperature phase transitions that occur. The basic method follows a novel approach originated studied the properties of antiferro-magnetic Heisenberg spin-, chains with random exchange couplings. They analyzed the low-energy behavior via an approximate renormalization-group transformation in which the strongest exchange is decimated away, yielding a new eff'ective exchange coupling between what were third-nearest neighbors. The procedure is iterated and the distribution of renormalized exchange couplings kept track of. This distribution becomes extremely broad, which makes the approximation better and better. It is this crucial feature of the renormalization-group (RG) transformation which will enable us to obtain many new exact results for this and other random quantum spin chains. Although Dasgupta and Ma did not find exact fixed points of their transformation , they guessed essentially the correct behavior from numerical studies and an approximate analysis of the RG fiow equation for the distribution of exchange couplings, 6nding a zero-temperature phase which has since been dubbed a "random-singlet" phase. ' In a recent paper, " the present author used a generalization of Dasgupta and Ma's method to analyze the critical behavior of random transverse Seld Ising spin chains, which are related to two-dimensional (2D) Ising models with couplings that are uniform along strips, but random from strip to strip-the partially-exactly-solvable McCoy-Wu model. ' In this paper we will extend Dasg-upta and Ma's results on Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains to analyze more general antiferromagnetic spin chains including the effects of anisotropy, the phase diagrams , the nature of disordered phases, and some of the phase transitions that can occur, in particular, that from},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$} At the core of every frustrated system, one can identify the existence of frustrated rings that are usually interpreted in terms of single–particle physics. We check this point of view through a careful analysis of the entanglement entropy of both models that admit an exact single–particle decomposition of their Hilbert space due to integrability and those for which the latter is supposed to hold only as a low energy approximation. In particular, we study generic spin chains made by an odd number of sites with short-range antiferromagnetic interactions and periodic boundary conditions, thus characterized by a {$<$}italic{$>$}weak{$<$}/italic{$>$} , i.e. nonextensive, frustration. While for distances of the order of the correlation length the phenomenology of these chains is similar to that of the non-frustrated cases, we find that correlation functions involving a number of sites scaling like the system size follow different rules. We quantify the long-range correlations through the von Neumann entanglement entropy, finding that indeed it violates the area law, while not diverging with the system size. This behavior is well fitted by a universal law that we derive from the conjectured single–particle picture. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {There is a large variety of quantum and classical systems in which the quenched disorder plays a dominant r\textbackslash\^ole over quantum, thermal, or stochastic fluctuations : these systems display strong spatial heterogeneities, and many averaged observables are actually governed by rare regions. A unifying approach to treat the dynamical and/or static singularities of these systems has emerged recently, following the pioneering RG idea by Ma and Dasgupta and the detailed analysis by Fisher who showed that the Ma-Dasgupta RG rules yield asymptotic exact results if the broadness of the disorder grows indefinitely at large scales. Here we report these new developments by starting with an introduction of the main ingredients of the strong disorder RG method. We describe the basic properties of infinite disorder fixed points, which are realized at critical points, and of strong disorder fixed points, which control the singular behaviors in the Griffiths-phases. We then review in detail applications of the RG method to various disordered models, either (i) quantum models, such as random spin chains, ladders and higher dimensional spin systems, or (ii) classical models, such as diffusion in a random potential, equilibrium at low temperature and coarsening dynamics of classical random spin chains, trap models, delocalization transition of a random polymer from an interface, driven lattice gases and reaction diffusion models in the presence of quenched disorder. For several one-dimensional systems, the Ma-Dasgupta RG rules yields very detailed analytical results, whereas for other, mainly higher dimensional problems, the RG rules have to be implemented numerically. If available, the strong disorder RG results are compared with another, exact or numerical calculations.},

Lett. 8, 9 (1989)], we propose a disorder-dependent real space renormalization approach. This approach allows to recover that a chain with a symmetric distribution in hydrophobic/hydrophilic components is localized at any temperature in the thermodynamic limit, whereas a dissymmetric distribution in hydrophobic/hydrophilic components leads to a delocalization phase transition. It yields in addition explicit expressions for thermodynamic quantities as well as a very detailed description of the statistical properties of the heteropolymer conformations in the high temperature limit. In particular, scaling distributions are given for the lengths of the blobs in each solvent, for the polymer density, and for some correlation functions. In the case of a small dissymmetry in hydrophobic/hydrophilic components, the renormalization approach yields explicit expressions for the delocalization transition temperature and for the critical behaviors of various quantities: in particular, the free energy presents an essential singularity at the transition (the transition is thus of infinite order), the typical length of blobs in the preferred solvent diverges with an essential singularity, whereas the typical length of blobs in the other solvent diverges algebraically. Finite-size properties are also characterized in details in both cases. In particular, we give the probability distribution of the delocalization temperature for the ensemble of random chains of finite (large) length L, and the distribution of the numbers of blobs for the chains that are still localized at a given temperature. Finally, we discuss the non-equilibrium dynamics at temperature T starting from a zero-temperature initial condition.},

The same qualitative behavior appears to occur for three-dimensions; we have not yet been able to determine whether or not it persists to arbitrarily high d.

Because frustration is irrelevant in the infinite-randomness limit, the same fixed point should govern both ferromagnetic and spin-glass quantum critical points.

  abstract = {We investigate the logarithmic negativity in strongly-disordered spin chains in the random-singlet phase. We focus on the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain and the random XX chain. We find that for two arbitrary intervals the disorder-averaged negativity and the mutual information are proportional to the number of singlets shared between the two intervals. Using the strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG), we prove that the negativity of two adjacent intervals grows logarithmically with the intervals length. In particular, the scaling behavior is the same as in conformal field theory, but with a different prefactor. For two disjoint intervals the negativity is given by a universal simple function of the cross ratio, reflecting scale invariance. As a function of the distance of the two intervals, the negativity decays algebraically in contrast with the exponential behavior in clean models. We confirm our predictions using a numerical implementation of the SDRG method. Finally, we also implement DMRG simulations for the negativity in open spin chains. The chains accessible in the presence of strong disorder are not sufficiently long to provide a reliable confirmation of the SDRG results.},

  abstract = {The discovery of novel entanglement patterns in quantum many-body systems is a prominent research direction in contemporary physics. Here we provide the example of a spin chain with random and inhomogeneous couplings that in the ground state exhibits a very unusual area law violation. In the clean limit, i.e., without disorder, the model is the rainbow chain and has volume law entanglement. We show that, in the presence of disorder, the entanglement entropy exhibits a power-law growth with the subsystem size, with an exponent 1/2. By employing the Strong Disorder Renormalization Group (SDRG) framework, we show that this exponent is related to the survival probability of certain random walks. The ground state of the model exhibits extended regions of short-range singlets (that we term ``bubble'' regions) as well as rare long range singlet (``rainbow'' regions). Crucially, while the probability of extended rainbow regions decays exponentially with their size, that of the bubble regions is power law. We provide strong numerical evidence for the correctness of SDRG results by exploiting the free-fermion solution of the model. Finally, we investigate the role of interactions by considering the random inhomogeneous XXZ spin chain. Within the SDRG framework and in the strong inhomogeneous limit, we show that the above area-law violation takes place only at the free-fermion point of phase diagram. This point divides two extended regions, which exhibit volume-law and area-law entanglement, respectively.},

  abstract = {The history of the discovery of the « exclusion principle », for which I have received the honor of the Nobel Prize award in the year 1945, goes back to my students days in Munich. While, in school in Vienna, I had already obtained some knowledge of classical physics and the then new Einstein rel-ativity theory, it was at the University of Munich that I was introduced by Sommerfeld to the structure of the atom-somewhat strange from the point of view of classical physics. I was not spared the shock which every physicist, accustomed to the classical way of thinking, experienced when he came to know of Bohr's « basic postulate of quantum theory » for the first time. At that time there were two approaches to the difficult problems connected with the quantum of action. One was an effort to bring abstract order to the new ideas by looking for a key to translate classical mechanics and electrodynamics into quantum language which would form a logical generalization of these. This was the direction which was taken by Bohr's « correspondence principle ». Sommerfeld, however, preferred, in view of the difficulties which blocked the use of the concepts of kinematical models, a direct interpretation, as independent of models as possible, of the laws of spectra in terms of integral numbers, following, as Kepler once did in his investigation of the planetary system, an inner feeling for harmony. Both methods, which did not appear to me irreconcilable, influenced me. The series of whole numbers 2, 8, 18, 32... giving the lengths of the periods in the natural system of chemical elements, was zealously discussed in Munich, including the remark of the Swedish physicist, Rydberg, that these numbers are of the simple form 2 n 2 , if n takes on all integer values. Sommerfeld tried especially to connect the number 8 and the number of corners of a cube. A new phase of my scientific life began when I met Niels Bohr personally for the first time. This was in 1922, when he gave a series of guest lectures at Göttingen, in which he reported on his theoretical investigations on the Periodic System of Elements. I shall recall only briefly that the essential progress made by Bohr's considerations at that time was in explaining, by means of the spherically symmetric atomic model, the formation of the intermediate},

Given that the logarithmic negativity is not a convex function this result is surprising as it is generally considered that convexity describes the local physical process of losing information. The role of convexity and in particular its relation (or lack thereof) to physical processes is discussed and the importance of continuity in this context is stressed. PACS numbers: 03.67.Mn, 05.70.-a Introduction-Entanglement is the key resource in many quantum information processing protocols. Therefore it is of interest to develop a detailed understanding of its properties. In view of the resource character of entan-glement it is of particular interest to be able to quantify entanglement [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Any resource is intimately related to a constraint which the resource allows to overcome. Therefore, the detailed character of entanglement and its quantification as a resource depends on the constraints that are being imposed on the set of operations. In a communication setting where two spatially separated parties aim to manipulate a joint quantum state it is natural to restrict attention to local quantum operations and classical communication (LOCC). In this case separable states are freely available while non-separable states, which cannot be prepared by LOCC alone, become a resource. The phenomenon of bound entanglement [6], i.e. non-separable states that possess a positive partial transpose and are useless to distill pure maximally entangled states by LOCC [7, 8], suggest that there are other natural restricted classes of operations. One might add bound entangled states as a free resource to LOCC operations to achieve tasks that are impossible under LOCC alone [9, 10, 11]. Encompassing both classes is the mathematically more natural and convenient class of positive partial transpose preserving operations (PPT-operations) [12] which have the property that they map the set of positive partial transpose states into itself just as LOCC operations map the set of separable states into itself. Under this set of operations distillable quantum states become a valuable resource while bound entanglement is free. A function E that is suggested to quantify entangle-ment must satisfy certain conditions. Apart from the requirement that E vanishes on the set of states that can be created using LOCC (or PPT) alone, the most important property is that of the non-increase on average of E under LOCC (or PPT) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ie},

This effective central charge is obtained for Heisenberg, XX, and quantum Ising chains using an analytic real-space renormalization group approach believed to be asymptotically exact. For these random chains, the effective universal central charge is characteristic of a universality class and is consistent with a c-theorem.},

  abstract = {We present a scheme to efficiently simulate, with a classical computer, the dynamics of multipartite quantum systems on which the amount of entanglement (or of correlations in the case of mixed-state dynamics) is conveniently restricted. The evolution of a pure state of n qubits can be simulated by using computational resources that grow linearly in n and exponentially in the entanglement. We show that a pure-state quantum computation can only yield an exponential speed-up with respect to classical computations if the entanglement increases with the size n of the computation, and gives a lower bound on the required growth. PACS numbers: 03.67.-a, 03.65.Ud, 03.67.Hk In quantum computation, the evolution of a multipar-tite quantum system is used to efficiently perform computational tasks that are believed to be intractable with a classical computer. For instance, provided a series of severe technological difficulties are overcome, Shor's quantum algorithm [1] can be used to decompose a large number into its prime factors efficiently-that is, exponentially faster than with any known classical algorithm. While it is not yet clear what physical resources are responsible for such suspected quantum computational speed-ups, a central observation, as discussed by Feyn-man [2], is that simulating quantum systems by classical means appears to be hard. Suppose we want to simulate the joint evolution of n interacting spin systems, each one described by a two-dimensional Hilbert space H 2. Expressing the most general pure state |Ψ ∈ H 2 ⊗n of the n spins already requires specifying about 2 n complex numbers c i1···in , |Ψ = 1 i1=0 · · · 1 in=0 c i1···in |i 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ |i n , (1) where \{|0, |1 ∈ H 2 \} denotes a single-spin orthonormal basis; and computing its evolution in time is not any simpler. This exponential overhead of classical computational resources-as compared to the quantum resources needed to directly implement the physical evolution by using n spin systems-strongly suggests that quantum systems are indeed computationally more powerful than classical ones. On the other hand, some specific quantum evolutions can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer-and therefore cannot yield an exponential computational speed-up. Examples include a system of fermions with only quadratic interactions [3], or a set of two-level systems or qubits initially prepared in a computational-basis state and acted upon by gates from the Clifford group [4]. Recently, Jozsa and Linden [5] have also shown how to efficiently simulate any quantum evolution of an n-qubit system when its state factors, at all times, into a product of states each one involving, at most, a constant (i.e. independent of n) number of qubits. Here we show how to efficiently simulate, with a classical computer, pure-state quantum dynamics of n entangled qubits, whenever only a restricted amount of entan-glement is present in the system. It follows that entan-glement is a necessary resource in (pure-state) quantum computational speed-ups. More generally, we establish an upper bound, in terms of the amount of entangle-ment, for the maximal speed-up a quantum computation can achieve. An analogous upper bound, but in terms of correlations (either classical or quantum), also applies to quantum computations with mixed states. For simplicity sake the analysis is focused on a computation in the quantum circuit model. Thus we consider a discretized evolution of the n qubits, initially in state |0 ⊗n , according to a sequence of poly(n) (i.e., a number polynomial in n) single-qubit and two-qubit gates. We recall, however, that any evolution of n qubits according to single-qubit and two-qubit Hamiltonians can be efficiently approximated, with arbitrary accuracy, by the above circuit model, so that the present results also apply to this more general setting [6]. Consider, as in Eq. (1), a pure state |Ψ ∈ H 2 ⊗n of an n-qubit system. Let A denote a subset of the n qubits and B the rest of them. The Schmidt decomposition SD of |Ψ with respect to the partition A:B reads |Ψ = χ A α=1 λ α |Φ [A] α ⊗ |Φ [B] α , (2) where the vector |Φ [A] α (|Φ [B] α) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue |λ α | 2 {$>$} 0 of the reduced density matrix ρ [A] (ρ [B]), whereas the coefficient λ α follows from the relation Φ [A] α |Ψ = λ α |Φ [B] α. The Schmidt rank χ A is a natural measure of the entanglement between the qubits in A and those in B [7]. Accordingly, we quantify the entanglement of state |Ψ by χ , χ ≡ max A χ A , (3) that is, by the maximal Schmidt rank over all possible bi-partite splittings A:B of the n qubits. We shall say that |Ψ is only slightly entangled if χ is "small". In particular , here we are interested in sequences of states \{|Ψ n \} of},

This configuration of the couplings is suggested by real-space renormalization group arguments. Computation of the entanglement entropy is performed by mapping the system to free fermions and diagonalizing numerically its correlation matrix. An analytical relationship between the entanglement entropy and the Frobenius norm of the correlation matrix is also established. Our result is complementary to the known relationship between non-translational invariant, nearest-neighbor interacting Hamiltonians and quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)- complete problems. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

  abstract = {We investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy in an infinite translational invariant fermionic system of any spatial dimension. The states under consideration are ground states and excitations of tight-binding Hamiltonians with arbitrary interactions. We show that the entropy of a finite region typically scales with the area of the surface times a logarithmic correction. Thus, in contrast with analogous bosonic systems, the entropic area law is violated for fermions. The relation between the entanglement entropy and the structure of the Fermi surface is discussed, and it is proven that the presented scaling law holds whenever the Fermi surface is finite. This is, in particular, true for all ground states of Hamiltonians with finite range interactions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},
